IT'S OVERLY SENTIMENTAL AND AT TIMES TERRIBLY MUSHY , NOT TO MENTION VERY MANIPULATIVE .
BUT OH , HOW ENJOYABLE THAT MANIPULATION     IS .
BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE CASTING AND MANIPULATION THAT MAKES THE MOVIE WORK AS WELL AS IT DOES , BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY HATED THE PREVIOUS RYAN HANKS TEAMING , SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE .
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE DIRECTING , BECAUSE BOTH FILMS WERE HELMED BY THE SAME WOMAN .
I HAVEN'T QUITE YET FIGURED OUT WHAT I LIKED SO MUCH ABOUT YOU'VE GOT MAIL , BUT THEN AGAIN , IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT ?
IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING SO MUCH , WHY EVEN QUESTION IT ?
AGAIN , THE STORYLINE IS AS CLICHED AS THEY COME .
TOM HANKS PLAYS JOE FOX , THE INSANELY LIKEABLE OWNER OF A DISCOUNT BOOK CHAIN AND MEG RYAN PLAYS KATHLEEN KELLEY , THE EVEN MORE INSANELY LIKEABLE PROPRIETOR   OF A FAMILY-RUN CHILDREN'S BOOK SHOP CALLED , IN A NICE HOMAGE , THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER .
